# Summary

If you don't know what is a Plague Doctor, you should check this article: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plague_doctor 

Basically, this is someone that was suppose to cure you from plague, but all he did was scare you and beat you with some kind of a stick. :) Still, this is one of the scariest real world things I have ever seen. This is why I made the low poly version of the mask.

As usual, here is a link to my Etsy store where you can get the PDF DIY template:

# How I Designed This

## I have designed it in Rhino 5 with T-Splines plugin.
